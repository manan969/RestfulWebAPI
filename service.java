Creating a CRUDS functionality for a ticket tracker application involves several steps. Here's a general outline of what you'll need to do:

    Set Up Your Development Environment: Make sure you have your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) installed, along with any necessary frameworks and dependencies (e.g., Spring Boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf for templating).

    Create a Spring Boot Project: Use Spring Initializr or your IDE to create a new Spring Boot project. Make sure to include dependencies for web, JPA, and any other necessary dependencies for your chosen database.

    Define Entity Classes: Create Java classes to represent your ticket entities (e.g., Ticket). Annotate these classes with JPA annotations to define the database schema.

    Implement Repository Interfaces: Create repository interfaces (e.g., TicketRepository) that extend JpaRepository to handle CRUD operations for your entities.

    Create Controller Classes: Define controller classes (e.g., TicketController) to handle HTTP requests. Implement methods for CRUD operations (e.g., createTicket(), getTicketById(), updateTicket(), deleteTicket()).

    Implement Service Layer: Create service classes (e.g., TicketService) to encapsulate business logic. These classes will interact with the repository layer to perform CRUD operations.

    Implement Views: Create HTML templates using Thymeleaf or your preferred templating engine to provide views for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tickets. Include forms for submitting data and tables for displaying ticket information.

    Implement Search Functionality: Add a search feature that allows users to search tickets by title and short description. Implement this functionality in your controller and service layers.

    Test Your Application: Test each CRUD operation to ensure that they work as expected. Also, test the search functionality to verify that it returns the correct results.

    Refactor and Optimize: Review your code for any potential improvements, such as optimizing database queries, handling exceptions, and improving user experience.

Remember to follow best practices for coding, such as using proper naming conventions, adding comments for clarity, and organizing your code into logical packages and classes. Also, consider security aspects such as input validation and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

Sure, let's start by creating the entity class for the ticket:

java

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Ticket {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private String description;
    
    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}

Next, we'll create the repository interface for handling CRUD operations:

java

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface TicketRepository extends JpaRepository<Ticket, Long> {
    // Additional methods for custom queries if needed
}

Now, let's create the service class to encapsulate business logic:

java

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

@Service
public class TicketService {
    @Autowired
    private TicketRepository ticketRepository;
    
    public List<Ticket> getAllTickets() {
        return ticketRepository.findAll();
    }
    
    public Optional<Ticket> getTicketById(Long id) {
        return ticketRepository.findById(id);
    }
    
    public Ticket createTicket(Ticket ticket) {
        return ticketRepository.save(ticket);
    }
    
    public Ticket updateTicket(Long id, Ticket ticket) {
        if (ticketRepository.existsById(id)) {
            ticket.setId(id);
            return ticketRepository.save(ticket);
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Ticket not found with id: " + id);
        }
    }
    
    public void deleteTicket(Long id) {
        ticketRepository.deleteById(id);
    }
    
    // Method for searching tickets by title and description
    public List<Ticket> searchTickets(String keyword) {
        return ticketRepository.findByTitleContainingOrDescriptionContaining(keyword, keyword);
    }
}

Now, let's create the controller class to handle HTTP requests:

java

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/tickets")
public class TicketController {
    @Autowired
    private TicketService ticketService;
    
    @GetMapping
    public List<Ticket> getAllTickets() {
        return ticketService.getAllTickets();
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Optional<Ticket> getTicketById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return ticketService.getTicketById(id);
    }
    
    @PostMapping
    public Ticket createTicket(@RequestBody Ticket ticket) {
        return ticketService.createTicket(ticket);
    }
    
    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Ticket updateTicket(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Ticket ticket) {
        return ticketService.updateTicket(id, ticket);
    }
    
    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteTicket(@PathVariable Long id) {
        ticketService.deleteTicket(id);
    }
    
    // Endpoint for searching tickets
    @GetMapping("/search")
    public List<Ticket> searchTickets(@RequestParam String keyword) {
        return ticketService.searchTickets(keyword);
    }
}

These are the basic components for implementing CRUD operations and search functionality in a Spring Boot application. You'll need to create corresponding HTML templates for the views and configure your database settings in the application.properties file. Additionally, you may want to add error handling and validation to improve the robustness of your application.

To achieve the requirements outlined in the problem statement, you'll need to set up a Spring MVC project with Hibernate ORM for database operations. Below, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to implement the functionalities:

    Set Up Project:
        Create a new Spring MVC project using your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
        Configure the project to use Hibernate ORM for database operations.

    Define Entity Class:
        Create an entity class Student representing the table structure.
        Annotate the class with Hibernate annotations to map it to the database table.

    Create Repository Interface:
        Create a repository interface StudentRepository extending JpaRepository<Student, Long> to handle CRUD operations.

    Implement Service Layer:
        Create a service class StudentService to encapsulate business logic.
        Implement methods for CRUD operations (e.g., createStudent(), updateStudent(), deleteStudent(), getAllStudents()).

    Create Controller:
        Create a controller class StudentController to handle HTTP requests.
        Implement methods for each CRUD operation as well as for printing all records.
        Add security annotations for role-based access control.

    Configure Security:
        Configure Spring Security to define roles (USER, ADMIN) and access permissions.
        Restrict access to CRUD operations based on user roles.
        Use authentication mechanisms (e.g., form-based login) to authenticate users.

    Create Views:
        Create HTML views for inserting, updating, deleting, and printing student records.
        Include forms for submitting data and tables for displaying student information.
        Apply Thymeleaf or JSP for server-side rendering and dynamic content.

    Test the Application:
        Test each CRUD operation to ensure that they work as expected.
        Verify that access control is properly enforced based on user roles.
        Test the application in different scenarios to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
